# StarLanes_Python
Star Lanes (also known as Star Traders).
Python version by Andrew Vander.
Ported from my Perl version which I ported from a Basic version.

According to http://www.classictw.com/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=11882 ...
The original door game was written by Chris Sherrick.
Chris was inspired by a game called Star Traders (aka Star Lanes) that was
published in a book called The People's Book of Computer Games.
